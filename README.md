# Elevate-Labs-Task-2---Student-Record-Management-System
Create a CLI-based CRUD system for managing student records.

# StudentManagementSystem - Java CLI Project

The concepts used to build this Student Record Management System are:

- `Student` class â€“ to represent individual student data with ID, Name, and Marks.
- `ArrayList` â€“ to store and manage dynamic lists of students.
- `Scanner` class â€“ to take input from the user.
- Loops â€“ used a `do-while` loop to keep the menu running.
- Switch case â€“ to perform actions based on the user's choice.
- Conditionals â€“ `if-else` used to validate inputs and check student IDs.

## ðŸ“˜ Description

`StudentManagementSystem` is a simple Java console application that allows users to manage student records through a command-line interface. It supports:

- Adding student details  
- Viewing all student records  
- Updating a student by ID  
- Deleting a student by ID  

The system uses a menu-driven interface to let users perform these operations in a loop until they choose to exit.

- Unique student identification using ID  
- Simple and readable console outputs  
- Handles invalid input gracefully  
- Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- Uses Java Collections (`ArrayList`) for storage
